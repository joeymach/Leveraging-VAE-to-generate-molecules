# VAE-to-generate-molecules
This repo is the starter code for a VAE model is trained on a dataset of 250k molecules, and the objective is to generate valid small molecules for drug discovery. I've later turned this personal project into [Synbiolic](https://synbiolic.com/) where alongside a few of my team members, we've developed an end-to-end pipeline from small molecule generation, to virtual screening, to predicting the synthesis pathways (aka retrosynthesis) for the generated molecules.
